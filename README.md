# Professional README Generator
This repository takes in user input from pre-defined questions and creates a simple ReadMe document.

## Overview
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.


## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local mashine
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `node index` to run the app
4. Answer all the question
5. You can peview and copy your README from the newly created file named "MyREADME.md"

**Please note, you will need node.js to run this repository on your computer.**
